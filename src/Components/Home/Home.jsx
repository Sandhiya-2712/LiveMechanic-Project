<div className="electrical-content1">Electric vehicles (EVs) run on electricity instead of gasoline, reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainability. They come in different types, such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which provide efficient energy storage and longer life. Charging options include home charging, public charging stations, and fast chargers for quick refueling. Governments worldwide offer incentives like subsidies and tax benefits to encourage EV adoption and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</div>
